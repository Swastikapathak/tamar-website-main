                The smart waste management project primarily aims to develop and implement innovative waste management
                systems. These modern systems have been crafted to improve operational efficiency, urban cleanliness,
                and sustainable living across several sectors. The fundamental aspect of the solution clearly is the
                automated dustbin made with recyclable materials, which are equipped with advanced sensors and integrated
                with smart technology. These advanced bins are incorporated with algorithms to automatically segregate
                waste into three different varieties â€“ dry, wet, and common. The inclusion of a smart system carefully
                monitors the bin fill level in real time and communicates the data to a cloud-based platform. The entire
                system has been designed meticulously to empower efficient waste collection, minimize environmental
                impact, and reduce unnecessary trips.

            <motion.p variants={itemVariants} className="text-gray-300">
              Conventional waste management practices followed in urban areas have led to several significant challenges.
              The inefficiency in waste segregation at source often leads to the loss of both recyclable and compostable
              materials. Keeping in mind the concept of circular economy and achieving sustainable development goals, it
              is pertinent to segregate the waste efficiently, at least in dry and wet categories. Moreover, monitoring
              the level of bin fill manually often leads to inadequate collection schedules. Most of the time, it results
              in litter accumulation, overflowing bins and spoiling the visual appearance of the cityscape. Such
              efficiency often translates into excessive fuel consumption, increasing overall labor costs and harming
              the environment with unnecessary vehicle emissions. In addition to this, manual collections are not always
              optimal, which leads to time waste, reducing service efficiency and increasing operational costs. These
              issues can significantly impact public sectors, urban health, and overall aesthetic appeal.
